Project Description: Building A Simple Shell

This collaborative project involves the development of a basic yet functional shell that possess the behavior of a standard command-line interface. This simple shell will serves as an interactive environment where users can execute various commands to interact with the system.

Key Features:

- Providing command prompt environment.
- Handling basic tasks that users usually performs on a command line, these inludes cat, ls, mkdir, touch, cd, vi, clear, exit, and more.
- Child process execution.
- A user-friendly interface which is familiar to the user.
- Project Collaboration - Members equally contributes to different aspects of the Shell development.

The tasks are:

0. Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks.

1. Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

2. Handle command lines with arguments.

3. Handle the PATH, fork must not be called if the command doesnâ€™t exist.

4. Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell.

5. Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment.

6. Write your own getline function

Use a buffafer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call.
You will need to use static variables.
You are not allowed to use getline.

7. You are not allowed to use strtok.

8. Handle arguments for the built-in exit

Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell.

9. Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands

setenv

Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
Should print something on stderr on failure
unsetenv

Remove an environment variable
Command syntax: unsetenv
VARIABLE
Should print something on stderr on failure

10. Implement the builtin command cd:

Changes the current directory of the process.
Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
You have to handle the command cd -
You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory
man chdir, man getcwd

11. Handle the commands separator ;

12. Handle the && and || shell logical operators

13. Implement the alias builtin command

Usage: alias [name[='value'] ...]
alias: Prints a list of all aliases, one per line, in the form name='value'
alias name [name2 ...]: Prints the aliases name, name2, etc 1 per line, in the form name='value'
alias name='value' [...]: Defines an alias for each name whose value is given. If name is already an alias, replaces its value with value

14. Handle variables replacement

Handle the $? variable
Handle the $$ variable

15. Handle comments (#)

16. Files as input

Usage: simple_shell [filename]
Your shell can take a file as a command line argument
The file contains all the commands that your shell should run before exiting
The file should contain one command per line
In this mode, the shell should not print a prompt and should not read from stdin
